/**
 * Gateway process supervision.
 *
 * The WorkBuddy gateway is a Python program that speaks the upstream
 * subscription protocol and re-publishes it as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
 * This module owns its lifecycle: spawn, readiness detection, log ring,
 * restart, and shutdown.
 *
 * Design constraints that shaped it:
 *
 * - **Spawn is injected**, not imported. `spawn` arrives through the
 *   constructor so tests drive the whole state machine without a Python
 *   interpreter or a listening port.
 * - **Readiness is observed, not assumed.** The gateway prints
 *   `listening : http://host:port/v1` once it is serving; that line is the only
 *   honest signal. A fixed sleep would report "running" during a slow boot and
 *   "stopped" during a fast one.
 * - **Mutable state lives outside the gateway checkout.** `accounts/` and
 *   `usage/` are redirected into `$DSH_HOME/workbuddy/` by environment
 *   variable, so a `link:`-installed plugin never writes into its own source.
 *
 * @module dsh-plugin-workbuddy-gateway/gateway
